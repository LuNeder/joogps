### Heyo! 👋

I'm João Gabriel, a 15-year-old student based in Brazil. Nice to meet you! My pronouns are he/him. 🇧🇷

Currently, during my free time, I'm learning about app development and looking forward to becoming a nicer human. I love reading and making stuff, from school assignments to apps and videos. I was also one of the [WWDC20 Swift Student Challenge](https://github.com/joogps/WWDC-2020) winners! 🏅

If you want to talk, feel free to reach me on my social links or send me an e-mail (you can find more info on the side panel). 📪
